# EchoSpection
EchoSpection : Exploring Spaces
Make your way through the dark in this minimalistic adventure.
Use echoes to echolocate obstacle; simply use arrow keys to avoid them. The catch is the obstacles aren't visible!
BEWARE: It's not that simple. It's not that hard. 

CUT THE "APPLICATION" FOLDER TO ANY DIRECTORY AND RUN "EchoSpection.exe" to play.
NOTE: Run at resolution 1280 x 600. (Not in full screen mode)
Please read HELP first.
